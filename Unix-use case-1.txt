USE CASE 1 – LOG FILE MANAGEMENT

Goal: Navigate folders, read logs, search for errors, sort logs, compress and archive them.

---

 STEP 0: Open MobaXterm

 Double-click `MobaXterm_Personal_25.4.exe`
 Wait for Local Terminal to open
 You should see prompt like:


┌──(sari㉿DESKTOP-CQEJB26)-[~]
└─$


This is your home directory (`/home/sari`).

---

 STEP 1: Create a simulated log folder

bash
mkdir log_demo
cd log_demo


 `mkdir log_demo` → create folder for logs
 `cd log_demo` → go inside the folder
 Prompt changes to:


~/log_demo
$


---

 STEP 2: Create sample log files

bash
echo "INFO: Server started" >> system.log
echo "ERROR: DB connection failed" >> system.log
echo "WARNING: High memory usage" >> system.log
echo "INFO: User logged in" >> system.log
echo "ERROR: Disk space low" >> system.log


 `>>` → appends to the file (creates if not exists)
 `system.log` → simulated server log

Check file exists:

bash
ls -l


Expected output:


-rw-r--r-- 1 sari users 123 Jan 26 10:00 system.log


---

 STEP 3: View last 3 log entries

bash
tail -n 3 system.log


Expected output:


WARNING: High memory usage
INFO: User logged in
ERROR: Disk space low


---

 STEP 4: Search for ERROR logs

bash
grep ERROR system.log


Output:


ERROR: DB connection failed
ERROR: Disk space low


---

 STEP 5: Sort log entries alphabetically

bash
sort system.log


Output (sorted lines):


ERROR: DB connection failed
ERROR: Disk space low
INFO: Server started
INFO: User logged in
WARNING: High memory usage


---

 STEP 6: Compare two logs using diff

(Optional: create another log)

bash
echo "INFO: Server started" >> system2.log
echo "ERROR: Disk space low" >> system2.log
diff system.log system2.log


 Shows differences between files

---

 STEP 7: Compress old log file

bash
gzip system2.log
ls -l


 Creates `system2.log.gz`
 Old file removed, compressed file exists

---

 STEP 8: Archive all logs

bash
tar -cvf logs_archive.tar .log .gz
ls -l


 `tar -cvf` → create archive
 `.log .gz` → include all log files
 You now have `logs_archive.tar` containing all logs

---

 ✅ STEP 9: Optional – Extract archive

bash
tar -xvf logs_archive.tar
ls -l


 Extracts archived logs
 Useful to verify contents


 SUMMARY OF COMMAND FLOW

| STEP | Command                              | Purpose                  |

| 1    | mkdir log_demo & cd log_demo         | Create folder for logs   |
| 2    | echo … >> system.log                 | Create sample logs       |
| 3    | tail -n 3 system.log                 | View last 3 entries      |
| 4    | grep ERROR system.log                | Search for ERROR logs    |
| 5    | sort system.log                      | Sort logs alphabetically |
| 6    | diff system.log system2.log          | Compare two log files    |
| 7    | gzip system2.log                     | Compress log             |
| 8    | tar -cvf logs_archive.tar .log .gz | Archive logs             |
| 9    | tar -xvf logs_archive.tar            | Extract logs             |


This simulates exactly what you would do on a real server in a corporate environment, like Volkswagen, but safely in MobaXterm local terminal.
