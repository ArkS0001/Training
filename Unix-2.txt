“In Volkswagen, we don’t install Unix on laptops.
We connect to Unix servers using MobaXterm via SSH.”

BEST & SAFE METHOD FOR VOLKSWAGEN COMPUTERS

  MobaXterm (Portable / Approved Tool)

 ✅ Why MobaXterm is suitable in Volkswagen

✔ No environment variables required
✔ No admin rights needed
✔ No PATH setting
✔ Works on Windows corporate laptops
✔ Used officially in many VW projects

 This is THE STANDARD method in automotive companies.

 ❌ Why other methods are NOT suitable

| Method   | Reason                  |
| -------- | ----------------------- |
| Linux VM | Admin rights needed ❌   |
| WSL      | Environment variables ❌ |
| Git Bash | Limited Unix commands ❌ |
| Cygwin   | Env variables ❌         |
| Docker   | Blocked ❌               |

So don’t even mention these to freshers — it confuses them.

 🔹 EXACT STEP-BY-STEP (VW Approved Flow)

 Step 1️⃣ Connect to VPN

(Very important)


Laptop → Volkswagen VPN → Internal Network


Without VPN → No server access.

---

 Step 2️⃣ Open MobaXterm (Portable)

No installation required
Just double-click:


MobaXterm_Personal.exe


---

 Step 3️⃣ Click Session → SSH

Fill details:

| Field       | Example     |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Remote host | 10.20.30.40 |
| Username    | vwuser      |
| Port        | 22          |

Click OK

---

 Step 4️⃣ Enter password

You’ll see:


vwuser@vw-linux01:~$


🎉 Connected to Unix.

> “You don’t need to install Unix.
> Unix already exists on Volkswagen servers.
> Your laptop is just a remote controller.”



REAL VW CORPORATE ARCHITECTURE (Simple Explanation)


Windows Laptop
     |
     | (VPN)
     |
Unix Server (Linux)
     |
Backend Apps
     |
Databases



Why we can’t set environment variables?

➡ Security policy.

 Why Unix is needed?

➡ All backend apps run on Linux servers.

Why not Windows server?

➡ Linux is stable, fast, and license-free.



 ✔ Use only:

 MobaXterm
 SSH
 VPN concept


DO NOT USE:

 export PATH
 env variables
 bashrc
 profile files
  (for Day-1 freshers)

 “These are advanced topics — you’ll learn later.”



> “In Volkswagen, Unix knowledge is not optional.
> Even testers and support engineers use it daily.”
