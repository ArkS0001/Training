 What is Unix?

Unix is an operating system used mainly for:

 Servers
 Production systems
 Cloud platforms
 Automotive backend systems

🔹 Very stable
🔹 Multi-user
🔹 Multi-tasking

 Most Volkswagen backend applications run on Linux/Unix servers.

 2️⃣ HISTORY OF UNIX

 Developed in 1969 at Bell Labs
 Created by Ken Thompson & Dennis Ritchie
 Written in C language
 Parent OS of:

   Linux
   AIX
   Solaris
   HP-UX

💡 Linux is Unix-like (same commands, same concepts).

 3️⃣ OVERVIEW OF UNIX

 Key Characteristics

 Multi-user system
 Multi-tasking
 Portable
 Secure
 Command-line based

 Why companies like Volkswagen use Unix?

 99.9% uptime

 4️⃣ ADDITIONAL FEATURES OF UNIX

✅ Process management
✅ Memory management
✅ File permissions

 5️⃣ GETTING STARTED WITH UNIX

 Ways to access Unix

 Putty
 MobaXterm
 Terminal
 Cloud VM (AWS / Azure)

 Unix prompt example:

bash
[vwuser@server01 ~]$


 `vwuser` → username
 `server01` → server name
 `~` → home directory

---

 6️⃣ BASIC UNIX COMMANDS

---

ls -l
ls -a


| Option | Meaning      |
| ------ | ------------ |
| -l     | long format  |

bash
cat file.txt


Used for log viewing.

---

 🔝 head / tail

bash
head file.txt
tail file.txt
tail -f app.log


 `tail -f` used heavily in Volkswagen for live logs.

---

 📂 pwd — present directory

bash
pwd


---

 📁 cd — change directory

bash
cd folder
cd ..
cd ~


---

 📁 mkdir / rmdir

bash
mkdir test
rmdir test


---

 🧹 rm — delete

bash
rm file.txt
rm -r folder


⚠ Dangerous command — use carefully.

---

 📋 cp — copy

bash
cp a.txt b.txt
cp -r dir1 dir2


---

 🔁 mv — move / rename

bash
mv old.txt new.txt


---

 📄 touch — create file

bash
touch test.txt


---

 🔍 grep — search text

bash
grep "ERROR" app.log


Used daily in production.

---

 🔎 find — search files

bash
find /var/log -name ".log"


---

 📍 locate

bash
locate passwd


Fast file search (uses database).

---

 🔃 sort

bash
sort names.txt


---

 📄 diff — compare files

bash
diff file1 file2


Used in deployment verification.

---

 📄 file — check file type

bash
file script.sh


---

 📘 man — help

bash
man ls


---

 7️⃣ UNIX FILE SYSTEM

 Root structure

| Directory | Purpose      |

| /         | root         |
| /home     | user home    |
| /etc      | config files |
| /var      | logs         |
| /bin      | commands     |
| /tmp      | temporary    |
| /opt      | applications |

Example:

bash
/var/log/app.log


 Volkswagen logs mostly stored in `/var/log`.

---

 8️⃣ LINKS — ln and ln -s

 Hard link

bash
ln file1 file2


 Soft link (shortcut)

bash
ln -s file1 shortcut


Used during deployments.

---

 9️⃣ COMPRESSION COMMANDS

 gzip / gunzip

bash
gzip file.txt
gunzip file.txt.gz


 zip / unzip

bash
zip data.zip file.txt
unzip data.zip


 tar (very important)

bash
tar -cvf backup.tar folder
tar -xvf backup.tar


Most application deployments use tar.

---

 🔟 FILE PERMISSIONS

Example:

bash
-rwxr-xr--


| Position | Meaning |

| r        | read    |
| w        | write   |
| x        | execute |

 User Types

 Owner
 Group
 Others

---

 1️⃣1️⃣ chmod — change permissions

 Numeric method

bash
chmod 755 script.sh


| Number | Permission |
| ------ | ---------- |
| 7      | rwx        |
| 6      | rw-        |
| 5      | r-x        |
| 4      | r--        |

---

 1️⃣2️⃣ ACCESS CONTROL LIST (ACL)

Used when normal permission is not enough.

 View ACL

bash
getfacl file.txt


 Set ACL

bash
setfacl -m u:john:rw file.txt


Used in corporate servers where multiple teams access same files.

---

 1️⃣3️⃣ chown — change owner

bash
chown user file.txt


---

 1️⃣4️⃣ chgrp — change group

bash
chgrp devteam file.txt


---

 🚗 VOLKSWAGEN CORPORATE REAL-TIME USE CASE

 Scenario:

Application logs failing.

Engineer runs:

bash
cd /var/log
ls
tail -f app.log
grep ERROR app.log


Fix permissions:

bash
chmod 755 script.sh
chown appuser script.sh


Compress logs:

bash
tar -cvf logs_backup.tar .log


 This is exact real production work.

✔ Unix is mandatory for backend engineers
✔ Commands are used daily in production
✔ Logs, permissions & file handling are most important
✔ Confidence comes from practice
