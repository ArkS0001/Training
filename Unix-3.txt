 🔹 PROMPT EXPLANATION 
You see:


┌──(sari㉿DESKTOP-CQEJB26)-[~/unix_training]
└─$


Let’s decode this 👇

| Part            | Meaning        |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| sari            | Username       |
| DESKTOP-CQEJB26 | System name    |
| ~               | Home directory |
| unix_training   | Current folder |
| $               | Normal user    |

 `~` = `/home/sari`

So:


~/unix_training
means
/home/sari/unix_training
